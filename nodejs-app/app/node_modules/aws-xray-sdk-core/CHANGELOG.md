* bugfix: Fixed issue where url capturing for incoming requests was coded to an Express-only property.
* bugfix: Fixed issue with S3 calls where only x-amz-id-2 was captured as request ID. Added 'id_2' property to properly capture S3 request ID pairs.
* bugfix: Fixed issue where capturing a count of parameters on a parameter of an AWS call when the parameter wasn't defined would capture 'undefined'.
